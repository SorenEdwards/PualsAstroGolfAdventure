# Modern Pual's Astro Golf Adventure (Written in Rust)
While mostly a hobby piece, this project aims to revive and move the COMP 2659 Atari Game Pual's Astro Golf Adventure into Windows, Mac, Linux, and possibly even the web!

### News
- The base is very bleak currently and just just proves that the transition off the atari is possible. Future iterations will include minor mouse support and the title and end screen as well as some more levels. 

### Future
- Once a more complete version is complete the final task will be to create a web assembly varient so it can be playable by all.
